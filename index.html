            Let's break down the landing page:

            There are about 6 main sections:
            
            1. Header/Navigation-bar 
            2. "This website is awesome" section
            3. "Some random information" section
            4. "This is an inspiring quote" section
            5. "Call to action!" section
            6. footer w/ copyright section

            The only solution that doen't come to mind easily is the
            call to action section
        -->
